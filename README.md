# Carpal Tunnel Severity Classification

This project focuses on classifying the severity of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) using machine learning techniques. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict the severity level based on input features derived from clinical data.

## Project Overview

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is a condition that causes pain, numbness, and tingling in the hand and arm. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent long-term damage. This project aims to automate the classification process to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing the severity of CTS.

### Key Steps:
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Results Interpretation
